# B+ Tree Dictionary Search

## Introduction
This GitHub repository contains an efficient implementation of a B+ tree data structure for a dictionary search application. The user can specify the fanout (degree) of the B+ tree and search for words in the dictionary. The implementation provides fast searching and retrieval of words, making it suitable for handling a large dataset.

## Features
- B+ tree implementation for the dictionary search
- User-defined fanout for optimal tree construction
- Fast word search and retrieval
- Detailed information provided during the search process
- Ability to handle a large dataset (test data of approximately 18,000 words included)

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the C++ source code.
3. Run the compiled program and provide the desired fanout.
4. Search for words in the dictionary, and the program will display the word if it exists along with relevant information during the search process.

## Test Data
The repository includes a substantial test dataset of approximately 18,000 words. You can extend the dataset further and test the efficiency of the B+ tree for larger datasets.

## Contributions
Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you have any improvements or additional features to add, please submit a pull request.


## Disclaimer
The B+ tree implementation provided here is designed for educational and experimental purposes. While it can efficiently handle a large dataset, it may not be optimized for production-level dictionary applications. Use it responsibly and appropriately.
